Todo:
	* event system (register events, blocking for IO...)
	  such that a high priority process will get automatically resched'd if it unblocks

	* Networking
	* VT-x
	* perf counters
	* shared libraries

Roadmap:

0.3 B1
	* refactor CPU code
	* test out a replacement of vmem code with something that doesn't suck
	* implement a "call function" IPI

0.3 B2
	* make sure all features listed in termcap are properly implemented
	* add chaining to file descriptors (and modify the return value for the sysconf entry)
	* Fix O_APPEND

0.4 
	* Proper Threading
	* CPU scheduling
	* SA_RESTART
	* user-space io port access
