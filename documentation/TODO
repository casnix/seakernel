Todo:
	* event system (register events, blocking for IO...)
	  such that a high priority process will get automatically resched'd if it unblocks

	* Networking
	* VT-x
	* perf counters
	* shared libraries

Notes:
	* Maybe tasks that are waiting by looping can do some kernel work while they're around

Roadmap:

0.3 B2
	* make sure all features listed in termcap are properly implemented
	* refactor driver code
	* refactor arch-dep code
	* fix driver arch-dep/arch-indep stuff

0.4 
	* Proper Threading
	* termcap features for vim
	* CPU scheduling
	* SA_RESTART
	* user-space io port access
