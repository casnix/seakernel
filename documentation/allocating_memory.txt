ALLOCATING MEMORY
=================

There exist several ways to allocate memory. There are two types of memory
that can be allocated, physical and malloc. Malloc memory allocation returns
a region of virtual memory from a specific section of the address space that
has physical memory backing it. There are also multiple ways to allocate
physical memory directly.

Physical
--------
Physical memory allocation works in granularity of pages. There are two
primary allocation mechanisms: stack-based and map-based. 

Stack-based allocation is done with two functions:

addr_t mm_alloc_physical_page()
void   mm_free_physical_page(addr_t)

The allocation function returns exactly 1 page, or panics with an out of
memory message. The free function takes exactly 1 page as an address. Each
consecutive call to the allocation function will not necessarily return
contiguous pages.

Map-based allocation is done with two functions:

void mm_alloc_contiguous_region(struct mm_physical_region *p)
void mm_free_contiguous_region(struct mm_physical_region *p)

struct mm_physical_region contains fields 'address', 'start' and 'alignment'.
The allocation function expects size and alignment to be filled out, and will
fill out the address field before the return of the function. If the
allocation function is unable to allocate the requested size and alignment,
it puts a zero in the address field. The free function expects the size and
address field to be filled out. Though size may be any value, the allocation
function operates in page size granularity. It allocates a section of
physical memory of size 'size', at most CONFIG_CONTIGUOUS_MEMORY.

Malloc
------
Physical memory cannot be easily directly accessed, so it is only useful to
allocate for very specific reasons. Thus, a family of functions are defined
to make allocating general purpose memory simple.

void *kmalloc(size_t s)
void *kmalloc_a(size_t s)
void *kmalloc_p(size_t s, addr_t *p)
void *kmalloc_ap(size_t s, addr_t *p)
void kfree(void *)

These functions return a void pointer to a section of memory that will be at
least of size s. Code that performs the allocation may not directly access
memory outside of the region bounded by the return value, and the return
value + s. The varients (the functions with underscores) do specialized
things. The 'a' ensures that the returned memory is page aligned. The 'p'
adds an additional parameter which is a pointer. The value is filled out
by the function call, and contains the physical address that the returned
virtual address is mapped to. The kfree function takes in any address
returned by kmalloc.

Other Allocation Mechanisms
---------------------------
DMA buffers can be allocated from the kernel. This is an extension of the
contiguous allocation system (map-based). The functions are:

int mm_allocate_dma_buffer(struct dma_region *d)
int mm_free_dma_buffer(struct dma_region *d)

struct dma_region contains a struct mm_physical_region, and a field that
contains a virtual address. The mm_physical_region must be filled out like
calls to mm_allocate_contiguous_region. The virtual address field will be
filled out during calls to the functions, and will map to a contiguous
physical memory region.

There is no way to allocate arbitrary virtual memory directly, without
the use of the vmem code.
